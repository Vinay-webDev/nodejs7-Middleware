// we can actually log these to the console to check to see if it's working 
// but really we would like to have it in log text file so to do thatðŸ‘‡
//ðŸ‘‰ create a middleware directory or folder 
//ðŸ‘‰ then drag the logEvents.js in middleware folder
//ðŸ‘‰ you might need to change the path for logs folder ( use '..' to go up one step ***);

//////////////Let's request data from another domain/////////////////////////////
// so as you can notice we got undefined in the request origin is because we are requesting data from localhost 
// Let's try to request data from another domain******
/* we got CORS err in the console and this will lead us to a third-party middleware 'CORS'
CORS === cross origin resource sharing 
so now we need to install cors as dependency to do that just write 
npm i cors

////let's go little deeper into the cors/////////////////////////
//app.use(cors()); // this is public which means this available for any domain** also any domain can request our data from our server
// however this is not that we always need. most of the times we need to have only the selected domains to request the data. we can actually do thatðŸ‘‡
// Let's create a whitelist which will have the list selected domains
const whitelist = ['https://www.yoursite.com', 'http://127.0.0.1:5500', 'http://localhost:3500'];

// then we'll need to have a function that will allow these selected sites to request data
// ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰remember origin parameter inside the function which is same as the origin property of the object (corsOptions) here the origin parameter inside the function is the origin of the site that is requesting data ==>> ( origin ===>>  the domain or the url of the site that is requesting the data )ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
const corsOptions = {
    origin: (origin, callback) => {
        // now we need to check if the domain or url or origin that is present inside our whitelist
        //if ( whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1 ) // if whitelist.indexOf(origin) is strictly not equal to -1  means is not present in the whitelist
        if ( whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1 ) {
            callback(null, true); // here null is error**
        } else {
            callback(new Error('not allowed by the CORS'));
        }
    }
}

app.use(cors(corsOptions));

//1.====>>> we got CORS error again because we don't have www.google.com in our whitelist
